content="""Common Issues and Debugging Tips

Developers new to StatefulSets often encounter a few recurring issues. Here are some common problems and how to address them:

    Pods Stuck in Init - If you use an initContainer (for example, to set permissions or download initial data), it may hang or crash due to permission issues. A typical scenario: an initContainer running as non-root tries to modify a volume that's owned by root. This results in “Operation not permitted” errors (as seen in logs). Solution: ensure the initContainer has the needed privileges or avoid that need altogether. As discussed, you can run the initContainer as root with a proper securityContext (and capabilities) to perform setup

    . Alternatively, do the setup in the Dockerfile (bake the needed permissions into the image) or use fsGroup to let Kubernetes handle it. Always check kubectl logs <pod> -c <init-container> for clues if a pod is stuck initializing.

    CrashLoopBackOff due to Volume Permissions - The main container of the StatefulSet might crash repeatedly with a permission error if it cannot read/write the mounted PVC. This happens if the volume's ownership doesn't match the container's user. For example, if the container runs as UID 1000 but the volume files are owned by root and not group-accessible, any write will fail. To debug, exec into the pod (or an init container) and run ls -l on the mount to see ownership. Fix by using the fsGroup approach (preferred) or by one-time chown as root (if policies allow). Once set correctly, the non-root app should be able to write. Also ensure your Docker image itself doesn't have restrictive permissions on the directories - sometimes an image's folder is owned by a specific UID/GID that doesn't match the one you intend to use. You may override runAsUser to match it or adjust the image's Dockerfile.

    PersistentVolumeClaims Pending - A StatefulSet won't create pods until its volumeClaims are bound. If you see your StatefulSet pods stuck in “Pending” state, do kubectl get pvc and check their status. If they are Pending, it means no PV is available to satisfy the request. In a local cluster, this could mean the default StorageClass isn't working or you forgot to set one. For quick tests, you might switch to an emptyDir (in the pod spec) to bypass PVs, but that sacrifices data persistence. The better fix is to install or configure a storage provisioner. For example, on kind you might install the local-path provisioner; on Minikube, ensure the storage-provisioner addon is enabled. Once a PVC is bound (Bound status), the pod should schedule. Use kubectl describe pvc <name> to see events - if it's stuck, you might see “waiting for first consumer” (which means the PVC will bind when the pod is scheduled, and the pod is waiting for a node - a scheduling issue perhaps) or “no storage class found”. Provide a valid storageClass or create a matching PV to resolve this.

    Volume Mounts but Data Missing or Stale - Remember that each StatefulSet pod gets its own volume. If you expected shared data between pods, that won't happen unless you explicitly used a ReadOnlyMany or shared volume type. For instance, if Pod 0 creates some data and you look for it in Pod 1, it won't be there (different volume). This is by design (use cases wanting shared data should consider NFS or other shared volumes, but that's outside typical StatefulSet usage). Also, if you delete a pod (not the whole StatefulSet), Kubernetes will re-create it and attach the same volume, so any data written will persist. If you wanted a clean slate on pod restart, you'd need to manually clear the PVC or use an ephemeral volume instead.

    Stale PVC after Scaling Down - If you scale down a StatefulSet (say from 3 replicas to 2), the PVC for the removed pod (e.g. “data-myapp-2”) remains bound and consumes resources. If you later scale up again to 3, it will reattach that same PVC. If you intended to reset the state for that pod, you'd have to delete the PVC manually after scaling down (and ensure the StatefulSet is not set to retain it via any custom policies). Keep an eye on leftover PVCs when recycling stateful apps in dev; they can accumulate.

    HostPath Specific Issues - Using hostPath can introduce non-obvious issues:

        If the underlying host directory gets deleted or its permissions changed outside of Kubernetes, pods will fail on startup (since the path might no longer exist or be accessible). Ensure type: DirectoryOrCreate if you want K8s to auto-create the path
        kubernetes.io
        .

        On some systems (e.g., using NFS-backed hostPath or certain filesystems), root inside the container might be mapped to nobody (root_squash), preventing writes even if you run as root. In such cases, you'd need to adjust NFS exports (e.g., enable no_root_squash on your NFS server)
        stackoverflow.com
        .

        Because hostPath mounts a host's directory, a container could potentially read sensitive host data or consume arbitrary disk space. In secured clusters, hostPath usage is often restricted or outright blocked. For local testing, it's fine with caution, but always double-check that files are being written where you expect on the host (to avoid filling up an unintended directory).

In general, debugging StatefulSet issues involves checking events (kubectl describe statefulset/pod), logs of all containers (including init containers), and verifying that the expected resources (PVCs, Services) are present. Many “mystery” issues come down to missing permissions or missing resources."""
