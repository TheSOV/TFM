get_image_information:
  description: >
    **Goal**  
    Get the required information for the given image name.

    <image_name>
    {image_name}
    </image_name>

    **Methodology**

    1. Get the image manifest with the get_docker_manifest tool.
    2. Then use the get_docker_image_details tool to get the image details.
    3. Finally, use the get_docker_pullable_digest tool to get the pullable digest.
    4. Return the JSON objectâ€”and nothing else.

    In any step, if there is missing information about the image, or the repo is 
    unknown, use the search_docker_images tool to get the image information.

    Remember that official images are always under the library/ namespace and are preferred. (official=True, verified=False)
    Verified images are always under a custom namespace and are preferred after official images. (official=False, verified=True)
    Automated images are always under a custom namespace and are preferred after verified images. (official=False, verified=False)
